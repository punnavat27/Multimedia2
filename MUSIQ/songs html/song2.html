                    On “HUMBLE.” Kendrick Lamar challenges his competition. It was released a week after the 
                    
                    first promotional single, “The Heart Part 4,” with a music video directed by Dave Meyers 
                    
                    and The Little Homies. It features religious imagery mixed with urban life, such as Kendrick 
                    
                    in priest’s robes and a moving re-enactment of Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting The Last 
                    
                    Supper—juxtaposing this with the concept of humility in the chorus. 
                    
                    
                    On a religious note, the song could also be a reference to the verse James 4:7.

                    "So humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
