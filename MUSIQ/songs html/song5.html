                    “Higher Power” is a song that arrived on a little keyboard and a bathroom sink at the 

                    start of 2020 and was mentioned briefly during the TogetherAtHome livestreamed concerts. 
                    
                    It was produced by Max Martin. It’s out on Friday, May 7th.


                    On April 30th, the band inadvertently released an advert of the song with a snippet of 

                    the music a week early, which was quickly deleted 30 minutes after it was posted. 

                    There are still videos of the 16 second clip out there on the Internet, especially 

                    on Twitter, Tumblr, and Reddit.


                    On May 3rd, a post was made on the official Coldplay TikTok featuring a fresh new clip 
                    
                    of the song, lasting 26 seconds. It can also be found on the bands Twitter.
