                    “Sunflower” marks the second collaboration by Post Malone and Swae Lee. It serves as the 

                    second single for Post Malone’s 2019 album, Hollywood’s Bleeding, and is part of the 

                    soundtrack for the 2018 animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The track would 

                    end up breaking the record for most weeks spent in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 

                    R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart after notching its 45th week.


                    Post first teased the song at The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on October 1, 2018. 
                    
                    He then confirmed on Facebook that the song would include Swae Lee. Two snippets from 
                    
                    the lyric video were shown on both of their Instagram accounts on October 15, 2018.
